Compatibility Layer
libfastjson offers some limited source code compatiblity to
json-c via preprocessor macros. They are currently primarily
targeted at what the rsyslog family of projects need.
Also, they do not work work properly with ./configure checks.
This is due to the way autotools checks for functions.

Differences to json-c
---------------------

* hash tables are no longer part of the API; we may use them
  internally, but we may also use any other data structure. This
  is not of concern for the caller.

* we do NOT handle NUL characters inside strings or names
  At the time of fork, json-c did not properly handle this, but
  could at least, with tricks, generate outbound json with NUL
  in string values. We do not support this.
  This also means libfastjson is not 100% JSON compliant. Sorry
  for that, but we try to keep things working great in the C
  spirit, and that JSON feature simply doesn't play well here.
  If you need 100% JSON compliance, look for another library.

* Windows and Android are not supported. If you want to actively
  maintain libfastjson on those platforms, please let us know
  and we can work together (a long term commitment) to get this
  going again.

* removed API calls:
  If you need any of this API calls urgently, please let us know
  why you consider it important enough to become re-added;
  especially let us know why you think this is important to the
  community at large. Thanks.
  * [f]json_c_version_num()

* renamed API calls:
  * all calls have been added an "f" in the front
  json_* --> fjson_*
  * the same holds true for preprocessor defines,
    JSON_C_* --> FJSON_* (note removal of "_C")
  * json_c_version() -> fjson_version()
